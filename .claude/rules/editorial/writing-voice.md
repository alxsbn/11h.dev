# Writing Voice

The blog's tone is conversational and opinionated. Write like you're talking to a colleague over coffee, not presenting at a conference.

- Short sentences. Direct statements. Opinions stated plainly.
- Cite concrete facts, numbers, real examples rather than vague generalities.
- If something is uncertain, say so once and move on. Don't hedge every sentence.
- Reuse the clearest word rather than cycling through synonyms.

## Personal voice for opinions

When expressing an opinion or interpretation, use first person. The blog is authored, not anonymous. "De mon point de vue", "ma lecture", "From where I stand", not detached third-person analysis.

## Don't underestimate the reader

Choose examples that respect the reader's intelligence. If most people wouldn't actually do something (like asking a company AI agent how to negotiate their salary), don't use it as an example. Pick realistic scenarios.
