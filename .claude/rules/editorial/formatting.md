# Formatting Rules

- No excessive bold (**word**) in body text. Bold is for headings and key terms only.
- No bullet lists unless the content genuinely calls for a list. Prefer prose.
- No emojis.
- **Em dashes (—) are banned.** Do not use them at all. Replace with periods, commas, colons, or parentheses. If you find yourself reaching for an em dash, stop and restructure the sentence.
- No empty conclusions that just restate the intro. If there's nothing new to say, end earlier.
