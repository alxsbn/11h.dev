excerpt: "In 1859, Baudelaire called photography 'art's most mortal enemy.' In 2025, Karpathy called AI code 'slop.' Both changed their minds. History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes."

**October 2025.** Andrej Karpathy: "Overall, the models are not there. It's slop."

**December 2025.** Same Karpathy: "I've never felt this behind as a programmer. A 10X boost is available and a failure to claim it feels decidedly like skill issue."

Two months to flip. But this story is 166 years old.

## 1859: Art's most mortal enemy

Charles Baudelaire, writing in the *Revue Française*, absolutely **despised** photography:

> "As the photographic industry was the **refuge of all failed painters, too ill-equipped or too lazy** to complete their studies, this universal infatuation bore not only the character of blindness and imbecility, but also the color of vengeance."

> "This industry, by **invading the territories of art, has become art's most mortal enemy**."

His conclusion? Photography must "**return to its proper duty which consists in being a servant** to the sciences and the arts."

Sound familiar?

- "Refuge of failed painters, too lazy" → criticisms of AI users today
- "Art's most mortal enemy" → what people say about AI and coding
- "Must remain a servant" → "AI should just be a copilot"

But here's the twist.

## 1862: The League Against Photography

Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, established master painter, **founded the "League of Artists Against Photography"** and led a formal "Protest by great artists against any assimilation of photography to art."

The irony? **Ingres himself used photography** to assist his paintings.

He saw the threat. Used the tool. But publicly fought to keep it subordinate.

Does this remind you of anyone?

## Karpathy = Ingres

Both are **established masters** of their craft.

Both **initially resisted** the new technology publicly.

Both **eventually adapted** (Karpathy in just 2 months, Ingres... well, he died still fighting).

The difference? Karpathy had the humility to update his mental model. Publicly. "Skill issue."

Ingres held the line and **lost to history**.

## The ones who won: those born with the camera

The **Impressionists**:
- Claude Monet (born 1840, **1 year after** the daguerreotype)
- Pierre-Auguste Renoir (born 1841)
- Paul Cézanne (born 1839, **the same year** photography was invented)

They didn't grow up mourning the "golden age of realistic painting." For them, photography **was just there**. Reality.

No baggage to drop. Nothing to unlearn.

So they invented something **the camera couldn't do**: impressionism, post-impressionism, eventually cubism and abstraction.

They didn't fight photography. They **made it irrelevant** by going where it couldn't follow.

## Today's impressionists

The developers born with AI don't see it as a threat to their identity.

They don't have **years of craft pride** tied to "writing clean code by hand."

They don't feel defensive about "code means typing characters."

They just **ship**. From Slack. While waiting for their kids at school.

Boris Cherny (creator of Claude Code): 259 PRs, 497 commits, 40k lines in 30 days. Every line written by Claude. To build Claude Code.

The juniors arriving now? They're the Monets of code. No resistance. Just **"what can I build with this?"**

## The question

Baudelaire and Ingres are footnotes in photography history. **Forgotten resistance**.

The Impressionists? They **defined modern art**.

The skill issue isn't coding. It's **letting go**.

Which side of history are you on?
